# Flex-Sensor-Silentra-Code
Silentra is an assistive device that helps mute individuals communicate by translating finger movements into letters using 5 flex sensors embedded on a glove. Based on which fingers are bent, specific letters are detected and displayed on an LCD screen. A buzzer also alerts on space insertion. The system uses a custom PCB for signal processing.
